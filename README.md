# Prefix
Since a lot of peapole used a leaked version of my prefix plugin I decided to redcode the old version and publish the source of the new one.

# Features
- Supports PermissionsEx v1.22.10
- Add prefixes via command
- Remove prefixes via command
- Customizable messages
- Easy to use gui with multiple inventories
